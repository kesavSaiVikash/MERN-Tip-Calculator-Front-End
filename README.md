#react #nodejs #expressjs #materialui
Hi guys! This is a Full stack Tip calculator Application created with #react #nodejs #expressjs.🕺 

One thing that is not normal 😬 here is #materialui 🎁 which I have used for styling and customizing the app.

🎄Material-UI for react is an amazing ocean of ready to use components, Theming engine, styling engine, icons SVGs and much more. You should give it a try too!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
